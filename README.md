# The Bible Narrative

It is not uncommon for people, when reading the Bible, to isolate each verse and chapter
as if it is its own entity. While this is not inherently bad, the Bible was not originally
written with chapters and verses; those came much later. Therefore, reading the Bible as a
single narrative in a more user-friendly format, can prove beneficial.

The Bible Narrative is a simple collection narrations I have written in my daily
devotions. *I must warn,* this narration is a paraphrase. While I strive to fit the
meaning of every single line and paragraph of the Bible, I cannot claim that every single
line of my narration is without error. There is of course the possibility of simple
mistakes such as a bad translation of units from random old Greek units to American
system units. More importantly, I warn that some things may be interpreted incorrectly
from the author's originally intent. In acknowledgment of this, I must implore you to read
your own Bible if you have the intent of deep study. If you are looking for a general
understanding of the story, I hope my narration is sufficiently accurate.
