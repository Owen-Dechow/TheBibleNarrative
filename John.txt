[1: 1-5]
Jesus is the word of God. He was with God when God created the world. Through Jesus all
things where made. Nothing that has come into existence came into existence without Jesus.
In Jesus was life, the light of man. By life, we mean freedom from the punishment of sin.
The light shines in the darkness. The darkness cannot overcome the light.

[6-13]
John came before Jesus to testify about the light so that people may believe through him.
The true light is Jesus; Jesus was there in the beginning and the world was made through
Jesus. Jesus came to his people, but Jesus' people did not know him. To the people who
know him, Jesus gives the right to be children of God. Not children of the flesh but of
the Lord God.

[14-18]
Jesus became human and lived as we do. We saw his glory, the glory of God's true son. He
was full of grace and truth. John said that Jesus had a higher rank than himself, that he
existed before him, at the beginning of time. It is through Jesus that we receive grace.
The law was given through Moses, but grace and truth are given through Jesus. No one has
fully understood God and his divinity, but Jesus is God.
